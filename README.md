About Lacky

Lacky is a load optimization program designed for logistics professionals to streamline the planning process for various transport configurations, including linehaul trucks, shipping containers, and medium rigid (PUD) trucks with or without trailer setups. With an emphasis on compliance and safety, Lacky automatically segregates Dangerous Goods (DGs) according to local laws, ensuring regulatory adherence with every load plan.

Initially, Lacky will display load configurations on a 2D grid, with future plans to evolve into a 3D interface for enhanced visualization. An innovative AI learning component will adapt to user input over time, refining load strategies based on loader feedback to create increasingly efficient plans. Users can modify load plans on the fly during the loading process, accommodating any real-world constraints or adjustments.

With secure account sign-on and load plan storage for up to 12 months, Lacky provides a dependable, long-term planning tool. Compatible with tablets, laptops, PCs, and phones, Lacky meets diverse operational needs across multiple devices, making it a highly adaptable solution for today’s fast-paced logistics environments.
